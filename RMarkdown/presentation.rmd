#TidyTuesday

- "Don't let language be a barrier to being involved in the R Community!"
- "Speak through your code!" >>> not ALL things but some like visualizations
- for explaining models and stuff, yes you WILL need better command of the English language...
- Recommend TidyTuesday as a way to get involved without needing to know as much English
--> "A picture is worth a thousand words!"
