__Animating__ the Goals of the World Cup: Comparing the __old__ vs. __new__ `gganimate` and `tweenr` API!

Welcome to Part 3 of my series on Visualizing the World Cup with R! This is the culmination of this mini project that I've been working on throughout the World Cup. In addition, from having listened to Thomas Pedersen's excellent keynote on the NEW gganimate and tweenr API, I am taking advantage of this fortuitous timing to also compare the APIs using the goals as the examples!

I've had finished these a couple of weeks ago but didn't make them publically available until I presented at the [TokyoR](https://twitter.com/TokyoRCommunity) MeetUp last week! __Hadley Wickham__ and __Joe Rickert__ were the special guests and with the amount of speakers and attendees it felt more like a mini-conference than a regular meetup, if you're ever in Tokyo come join us for some R&R! You can check out a recording of my talk on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNncHFd5dVo).

Let's get started!

## Coordinate position data

Several people have asked me where I got the data. I thought I made it quite clear in Part 1 but I will reiterate in the next few paragraphs.

I get a lot of my data science/visualization news from Twitter which has made a weird comeback (never thought I'll be creating a Twitter account in 2017!) by providing a platform to certain communities like #rstats. With that I've been able to come across some wonderful visualizations for the World Cup by __The Financial Times__, __FiveThirtyEight__, and a host of other people. As you can see from a great example of World Cup penalties by the __BBC__ below, data is provided by sports analytics companies, primarily Opta!

![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/79E6/production/_102260213_1_penalties_scored_640-nc.png)

Great! But can an average joe like me just waltz in, slap down a fiver, and say "GIMME THE DATA"? Well, unfortunately no, it costs quite a lot! This isn't really a knock on Opta or other sports analytics companies since FIFA or the FAs of respective nations didn't do this kind of stuff, the free market stepped in to fill the gap. Still, I'm 100% sure I am not the only one who wishes this kind of stuff was free though, well besides some datasets of varying quality you see on Kaggle (but none of those are as granular as the stuff Opta provides anyway). 

So, envious of those who have the financial backing to procure such data and some mild annoyance at others online who didn't really bother sharing exactly HOW they got their data or even what tools they used, I started thinking of ways that I could get the data for myself.

One possible way was to use RSelenium or other JavaScript web scrapers on soccer analytics websites and their cool dashboards, like [WhoScored.com](https://www.whoscored.com/). However, since I wouldn't have been able to master these tools before the World Cup ended (during which whatever I end up creating would be most relevant), I decided that I'll create the coordinate data positions myself!

![](https://i.imgur.com/Hn9X0GC.gif)

With the plotting system in [ggsoccer](https://github.com/Torvaney/ggsoccer) and `ggplot2` it's really not that hard to figure out the positions on the soccer field plot, as you can see in the picture below:

```{r example field, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(point_data) +
  annotate_pitch() +
  theme_pitch(aspect_ratio = NULL) +
  coord_flip() +
  geom_point(
    aes(x = x, y = y), 
    size = 1.5) +
  geom_text(
    aes(x = x, y = y,
        label = label),
    vjust = 1.5, color = "red")
```


![](https://i.imgur.com/ejgbOFg.png)

There's also a way to make the coordinates be in 120x80 format (which is much more intuitive) and you can do that by adding the `*_scale` arguments inside the `annotate_pitch()` function. However, I only realized this after I've embedded the coordinate positions for the 100x100 plot in my head so that's what I kept going with. 

There is also the "Soccer event logger" [here](https://github.com/Torvaney/elm-soccer-tracker) (incidentally also by [Ben Torvaney](https://twitter.com/Torvaney)) which allows you to mouse-click specific points on the field and then download a `.csv` file of those coordinate positions you clicked. This might be easier but personally, I like to experiment within the R environment and take notes/ideas in RMarkdown as I do so, it definitely is an option for others though.

... and that's how [Part 1](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2018-06-29-visualize-worldcup/) was born! But I wasn't going to stop there, soccer is a moving - flowing game, static images are OK but it just doesn't capture the FEEL of the sport. So this is where `gganimate` and `tweenr` came in!

Out of all the World Cup stuff I've animated so far, by far the most complicated was Gazinsky's goal in the opening game. This is because I not only have to track the ball movement but the movement of multiple players as well. So most of the **comparison** aspect of the APIs will be done with this goal.

Let's take a look at the packages that I'll be using:

```{r packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)    # general plotting base
library(dplyr)      # data manipulation/tidying
library(ggsoccer)   # draw soccer field plot
library(ggimage)    # add soccer ball emoji + flags
library(extrafont)  # incorporate Dusha font into plots
library(gganimate)  # animate goal plots
library(tweenr)     # create in-between frames for data
library(purrr)      # for creating a list of dataframes for tweenr
library(countrycode)# for finding ISO codes for geom_flag()
# loadfonts()         run once every new session
```

## Gazinsky's first goal:

Let's first look at the set of dataframes with the coordinate data points necessary for this to work:

```{r gazinsky data}
pass_data <- data.frame(
  x = c(100, 94, 82, 82.5,  84, 76.5, 75.5, 94, 99.2),     
  y = c(0,   35, 31, 22,     8, 13, 19, 60, 47.5),
  time = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9))

golovin_movement <- data.frame(
  x = c(78, 80, 80, 80, 75.5, 74.5, 73.5, 73, 73),  
  y = c(30, 30, 27, 25,   10,    9, 15, 15, 15),
  label = "Golovin",
  time = c(1, 2, 3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9)
)

zhirkov_movement <- data.frame(
  x = c(98, 90, 84, 84, 84, 84, 84, 84, 84),
  y = c( 0,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2),
  label = "Zhirkov",
  time = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
)

gazinsky_movement <- data.frame(
  x = c(0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 92,   92,   92,   92),
  y = c(0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 66.8, 66.8, 66.8, 66.8),
  label = "Gazinsky",
  time = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
)

# saudi defender
saudi_data <- data.frame(
  x = c(95, 95, 90, 87, 84, 80, 79, 79, 79),
  y = c(35, 35, 35, 32, 28, 25, 24, 25, 26),
  label = "M. Al-Breik",
  time = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
)

### soccer ball
ball_data <- tribble(
  ~x,  ~y, ~time,
  100,   0,   1,
  94,   35,   2,
  82,   31,   3,
  82.5, 25,   4,
  84,    6,   5, 
  77,   13,   6,
  76,   19,   7,
  94,   60,   8,
  99.2, 47.5, 9
  
) 

```

If you're manually creating these, you could also use `tribble()` instead of a `dataframe()`. It takes up a bit more space, as you can see in `ball_data`, but it is probably more readable for when you're sharing the code (like creating a reprex on SO or RStudio Community...).

NOTE: you need to be careful about the ordering of the ggplot elements. You need to make sure the soccer ball emoji code is near the end, after the labels so that the player name labels don't cover the soccer ball as its moving around!

```{r gazinsky old gganimate, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(pass_data) +
  annotate_pitch() +
  theme_pitch() +
  coord_flip(
    xlim = c(49, 101),
    ylim = c(-1, 101)) +
  geom_segment(
    data = segment_data, 
    aes(x = x, y = y, 
        xend = xend, yend = yend),
    size = segment_data$size,
    color = segment_data$color,
    linetype = c("dashed", "dashed")) +
  geom_label(
    data = saudi_data,
    aes(x = x, y = y,
        label = label),
    color = "darkgreen") +
  geom_label(data = zhirkov_movement,
    aes(x = x, y = y,
        frame = time,
        label = label),
    color = "red") +
  geom_label(data = golovin_movement,
    aes(x = x, y = y,
        frame = time,
        label = label),
    color = "red") +
  geom_label(
    data = gazinsky_movement,
    aes(x = x, y = y,
        label = label),
    color = "red") +
  ggimage::geom_emoji(
    data = ball_data,
    aes(x = x, y = y, frame = time),   
    image = "26bd", size = 0.035) +
  ggtitle(
    label = "Russia (5) vs. (0) Saudi Arabia", 
    subtitle = "First goal, Yuri Gazinsky (12th Minute)") +
  labs(caption = "By Ryo Nakagawara (@R_by_Ryo)") +
  annotate(
    "text", x = 69, y = 65, family = "Dusha V5",
    label = "After a poor corner kick clearance\n from Saudi Arabia, Golovin picks up the loose ball, \n exchanges a give-and-go pass with Zhirkov\n before finding Gazinsky with a beautiful cross!") +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Dusha V5"))

```

Now let's check out how we would do it with tweenr added in!

The important bit with the old API was that you had to create a list of dataframes of the different states of your data. In this case, it is a dataframe for each observation of the data or to put it more simply, the "time" variable (a dataframe of coordinate positions for time = 1, time = 2, etc.). This is done with `pmap()` with `dataframe()` being passed to the `.f` argument. 

With this list of dataframes created, we can pass it into `tween_states()` function to create the in-between frames to connect each of the dataframes in the list. Take note of the arguments in `tweent_states()` as they'll show up again in the new API later.

```{r old tweenr, eval=FALSE}
### soccer ball
b_list <- ball_data %>% pmap(data.frame)

ball_tween <- b_list %>% 
  tween_states(tweenlength = 0.5, statelength = 0.00000001, ease = "linear", nframes = 75)

### Golovin

golovin_movement_list <- golovin_movement %>% pmap(data.frame)
  
golovin_tween <- golovin_movement_list %>% 
  tween_states(tweenlength = 0.5, statelength = 0.00000001, ease = "linear", nframes = 75)

golovin_tween <- golovin_tween %>% mutate(label = "Golovin")

### Zhirkov
zhirkov_movement_list <- zhirkov_movement %>% pmap(data.frame)
  
zhirkov_tween <- zhirkov_movement_list %>% 
  tween_states(tweenlength = 0.5, statelength = 0.00000001, ease = "linear", nframes = 75)

zhirkov_tween <- zhirkov_tween %>% mutate(label = "Zhirkov")
```

Now with these newly created tween dataframes, we pass them into our ggplot code as before and specify the frame argument with the newly created `.frame` variable.

```{r gazinsky old tweenr, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(pass_data) +
  annotate_pitch() +
  theme_pitch() +
  coord_flip(xlim = c(49, 101),
             ylim = c(-1, 101)) +
  geom_label(
    data = saudi_data,
    aes(x = x, y = y,
        label = label),
    color = "darkgreen") +
  geom_label(data = zhirkov_tween,
    aes(x = x, y = y,
        frame = .frame,
        label = label),
    color = "red") +
  geom_label(data = golovin_tween,
    aes(x = x, y = y,
        frame = .frame,
        label = label),
    color = "red") +
  geom_label(
    data = gazinsky_movement,
    aes(x = x, y = y,
        label = label),
    color = "red") +
  ggimage::geom_emoji(
    data = ball_tween,
    aes(x = x, y = y, frame = .frame),   
    image = "26bd", size = 0.035) +
  ggtitle(label = "Russia (5) vs. (0) Saudi Arabia", 
          subtitle = "First goal, Yuri Gazinsky (12th Minute)") +
  labs(caption = "By Ryo Nakagawara (@R_by_Ryo)") +
  annotate("text", x = 69, y = 65, family = "Dusha V5",
           label = "After a poor corner kick clearance\n from Saudi Arabia, Golovin picks up the loose ball, \n exchanges a give-and-go pass with Zhirkov\n before finding Gazinsky with a beautiful cross!") +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Dusha V5"))
```

Now let's check out how things changed with the new API!

## NEW gganimate + tweenr

Once again, Let's start by looking at just animating across the time variable without creating in-between grames.

```{r gazinsky NEW gganimate, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
ggplot(pass_data) +
  annotate_pitch() +
  theme_pitch() +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Dusha V5")) +
  coord_flip(xlim = c(49, 101),
             ylim = c(-1, 101)) +
  geom_segment(
    data = segment_data, 
    aes(x = x, y = y, 
        xend = xend, yend = yend),
    size = segment_data$size,
    color = segment_data$color,
    linetype = c("dashed", "dashed")) +
  geom_label(
    data = zhirkov_movement,
    aes(x = x, y = y,
        label = label),
    color = "red") +
  geom_label(
    data = golovin_movement,
    aes(x = x, y = y,
        label = label),
    color = "red") + 
  geom_label(
    data = gazinsky_movement,
    aes(x = x, y = y,
        label = label),
    color = "red") +
  geom_label(
    data = saudi_data,
    aes(x = x, y = y,
        label = label),
    color = "darkgreen") +
  ggimage::geom_emoji(
    data = ball_data,
    aes(x = x, y = y),   
    image = "26bd", size = 0.035) +
  ggtitle(label = "Russia (5) vs. (0) Saudi Arabia", 
          subtitle = "First goal, Yuri Gazinsky (12th Minute)") +
  labs(caption = "By Ryo Nakagawara (@R_by_Ryo)") +
  annotate("text", x = 69, y = 65, family = "Dusha V5",
           label = "After a poor corner kick clearance\n from Saudi Arabia, Golovin picks up the loose ball, \n exchanges a give-and-go pass with Zhirkov\n before finding Gazinsky with a beautiful cross!") +
  # new gganimate code:
  transition_manual(time)

```

It's quite nice that I don't have to specify `frame = some_time_variable` in every geom that I want animated now!

However, you can see that like in the old gganimate code the new `transition_manual()` function just speeds through the specified "time" variable without actually creating in-between frames. 

Now let's use the other `transition_*()` functions to specify the tween frames and set the animation speed. 

Here I will use `transition_states()` with "time" being the column I pass to the "states" argument. Instead of having to create a `.frame` column with the `tween_states()` function I can just pass the "time" variable into the `transition_states()` function and it will tween the frames for you in addition to the `ggplot` code! The `transition_length` argument is the same as the `tween_length` argument from the old `tween_states()` function and `state_length` argument is the same here too.

Unlike in the version I showed in my presentation, I added Mohammed Al-Breik's movement as well. I felt it was a bit silly (and unfair) to show him just standing there after his headed clearance!

```{r gazinsky NEW tweenr, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
ggplot(pass_data) +
  annotate_pitch() +
  theme_pitch() +
  coord_flip(xlim = c(49, 101),
             ylim = c(-1, 101)) +
  geom_label(
    data = saudi_data,
    aes(x = x, y = y,
        label = label),
    color = "darkgreen") +
  geom_label(
    data = zhirkov_movement,
    aes(x = x, y = y,
        label = label),
    color = "red") +
  geom_label(
    data = golovin_movement,
    aes(x = x, y = y,
        label = label),
    color = "red") +
  geom_label(
    data = gazinsky_movement,
    aes(x = x, y = y,
        label = label),
    color = "red") +
  enter_grow(fade = TRUE) +
  ggimage::geom_emoji(
    data = ball_data,
    aes(x = x, y = y),   
    image = "26bd", size = 0.035) +
  ggtitle(
    label = "Russia (5) vs. (0) Saudi Arabia", 
    subtitle = "First goal, Yuri Gazinsky (12th Minute)") +
  labs(caption = "By Ryo Nakagawara (@R_by_Ryo)") +
  annotate(
    "text", x = 69, y = 65, family = "Dusha V5",
    label = "After a poor corner kick clearance\n from Saudi Arabia, Golovin picks up the loose ball, \n exchanges a give-and-go pass with Zhirkov\n before finding Gazinsky with a beautiful cross!") +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Dusha V5")) +
  # new gganimate code:
  transition_states(
    time, 
    transition_length = 0.5, 
    state_length = 0.0001,
    wrap = FALSE) +
  ease_aes("linear")

```

Great! 



Any cool new thing that you can play around with are the different enter/exit animations!

however, I couldn't really get it to work for Gazinsky's label... In the mtcars example on the gganimate github repo, the

I'm thinking I have to set up the Gazinsky label dataframe differently? I tried filling the coordinate positions for time 1-5 with NAs or 0s but it didn't seem trigger the effect ... when I tried with "0, 0" in `time = 5`, the label zipped in from the bottom of the screen to the penalty box at `time = 6` and it was unintentionally very funny!

any help there will be greatly appreciated!



## Osako's goal vs. Colombia

Japan faced a tough opponent in Colombia, even with the man-advantage in our opening game of the World Cup. Even with our passing tiring out the tenacious Colombians we were finding it hard to find a breakthrough. In came Keisuke Honda, who within minutes of his arrival, delivered a beautiful cross from a free kick for Osako to head home!

This goal was a lot easier to animate and to be honest this was the first one I was able to actually get working a few weeks ago! This was mainly because the ball movement was the only thing I really had to worry about.

```{r osako data}
cornerkick_data <- data.frame(
  x = 99, y = 0.3,
  x2 = 94, y2 = 47)

osako_gol <- data.frame(
  x = 94, y = 49,
  x2 = 100, y2 = 55.5)

ball_data <- data.frame(
  x = c(99, 94, 100),
  y = c(0.3, 47, 55.5),
  time = c(1, 2, 3))

player_label <- data.frame(
  x = c(92, 99), 
  y = c(49, 2),
  label = c("Osako", "Honda"))

wc_logo <- data.frame(
  x = 107,
  y = 85) %>% 
  mutate(
    image = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/67/2018_FIFA_World_Cup.svg/1200px-2018_FIFA_World_Cup.svg.png")

flag_data <- data.frame(
  x = c( 13, 53),
  y = c(110, 110),
  team = c("japan", "colombia")
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    image = team %>% 
           countrycode(., origin = "country.name", destination = "iso2c")
  ) %>% 
  select(-team)
```

tweenr

here I used one of the many easing functions available in tweenr, `quadratic-out` to get the speed of the ball from a corner kick just about right... You can refer to [this](https://easings.net/) awesome website to check out most of the different easing functions you can use in `ease_aes()`!

```{r osako NEW tweenr, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
ggplot(ball_data) +
  annotate_pitch() +
  theme_pitch() +
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = "Dusha V5"),
    plot.margin=grid::unit(c(0,0,0,0), "mm")) +
  coord_flip(
    xlim = c(55, 112),
    ylim = c(-1, 101)) +
  geom_label(
    data = player_label, 
    aes(x = x, y = y,
        label = label),
    family = "Dusha V5") +
  geom_point(
    aes(x = 98, y = 50), size = 3, color = "green") +
  annotate(
    geom = "text", family = "Dusha V5", 
    hjust = c(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5),
    size = c(6.5, 4.5, 5, 3),
    label = c("Japan             (2) vs. Colombia             (1)",
              "Kagawa (PEN 6'), Quintero (39'), Osako (73')",
              "Japan press their man advantage, substitute Honda\ndelivers a delicious corner kick for Osako to (somehow) tower over\nColombia's defense and flick a header into the far corner!",
              "by Ryo Nakagawara (@R_by_Ryo)"),
    x = c(110, 105, 70, 53), 
    y = c(30, 30, 47, 85)) +
  ggimage::geom_emoji(              # soccer ball emoji
    aes(x = x, 
        y = y),
    image = "26bd", size = 0.035) +
  ggimage::geom_flag(               # Japan + Colombia flag
    data = flag_data,
    aes(x = x, y = y,
        image = image),       
    size = c(0.08, 0.08)) +
  geom_image(                       # World Cup logo
    data = wc_logo,     
    aes(x = x, y = y,
        image = image), size = 0.17) +
  # new gganimate code:
  transition_states(
    time, 
    transition_length = 1.5, 
    state_length = 0.01) +
  ease_aes("quadratic-out")
```

As you can see it's quite easy and fun to make these! I am hoping to make more in the future, especially when the new season begins! 

For the final animation, I tried to recreate something you don't see everyday - an offside trap!

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/lk0TFUdop2JTW/giphy.gif)

## Japan's Offside Trap vs. Senegal!

```{r offside data}
# PLAYERS
# JAPAN: x, y (blue)     Senegal: x2, y2  (lightgreen)
trap_data <- data.frame(

take note of the "wrap" option, set it to false if you don't want the last state to transition back to the first frame (default == TRUE).

So against the height advantage and physicality of Senegal, the thinking behind Japan strategy was...

```{r meme, eval=FALSE}
library(memery)

meme_labs <- c("you can't lose the aerial battle", "if you set an offside trap")

meme(img, meme_labs, "offside_meme.png")

```

Jokes and memes aside, let's take a moment to reflect on the new API.

## Personal thoughts:

no intermediary steps >> if you have the time var you dont have to manually go and create the list of dataframe for each state yourself >>> transition_states() does it all for you in the ggplot code!!
dont have to deal with list dataframes and creating them and the extra step hassle of using tween)states() tunfction

made the mistake of runnign through the tween_states funs and THEN putting everything through transition_states again so it made everything weird...

`ease_aes(`) also allows you to specify the easing function of the transitions in the ggplot code as well.

With everything moved so that you can add in the animation grammar seamlessly with ggplot I feel you can read the entirety of the code better. As in, you don't have to refer back to a separate chunk of code that handled creating the tween frames. 

Now I'll talk about a few other new things that I didn't have a chance to show this time around.

all the varieties of enter/exit functions

`frame_vars()`

- before when explicitly creating the frames yourself with `tween_states()` you got an output of your dataframe with the expanded tween-frames. 

Now with the tweening done in the ggplot code you might think that you can't explicitly access them. But wait, this is where `frame_vars()` comes in! Using this function you can access metadata about each of the frames rendered in your latest animation:


```{r}
frames_data <- frame_vars(animation = last_animation())

glimpse(frames_data)

```

The `frame_source` column shows you where each individual frame image is saved so you can copy them, reuse them with magick instead, anything you want!

Panning and zooming across different states in the animation is another new concept introduced in the new gganimate with the series of `view_*()` functions like `view_zoom()` and `view_step()`. Within these you can use arguments like `pause_length` to specify the length of the zoomed view and `step_length` to specify the length of the transition between view points. I wasn't able to implement them in these GIFs as I had already used the `coord_*()` functions to focus on a certain area of the pitch and the events I was animating needed a wide perspective of the field. This may come into play in future goal or play animations where I'm recreating a neat bit of build-up play from a full field view then zoom in on the off-the-ball movement of a certain player, so definitely a set of functions to keep an eye on!

anim_save() >>> equivalent to ggsave()

before you used `gganimate()` to not only specify the nframes but to save the animation on your computer as well but now that is done with `anim_save()`

magick_renderer


There's still much to learn from the new API and I'm sure there will still be more changes/fixes to come before the first CRAN release but this was enlightening step in the right direction. I hope to keep using it in the future!
